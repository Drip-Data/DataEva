This could mean a runtime error in the sandbox or an issue with the code itself. I will try to debug the code by adding print statements and checking intermediate values. Also, I will simplify the `is_prime` function and ensure the prime generation logic is correct.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the `calculate_a_n` function logic.\nPrimes: 2 (idx 1), 3 (idx 2), 5 (idx 3), 7 (idx 4), 11 (idx 5), 13 (idx 6), 17 (idx 7), 19 (idx 8), 23 (idx 9), 29 (idx 10), 31 (idx 11), ...\n\nLet's test a few values manually:\n- For n = 87:\n  - Is 87 % 2 == 0? No. Least prime not dividing 87 is 2. Index of 2 is 1. So a(87) = 1.\n- For n = 88:\n  - Is 88 % 2 == 0? Yes.\n  - Is 88 % 3 == 0? No. Least prime not dividing 88 is 3. Index of 3 is 2. So a(88) = 2.\n- For n = 89 (prime number):\n  - Is 89 % 2 == 0? No. Least prime not dividing 89 is 2. Index of 2 is 1. So a(89) = 1.\n- For n = 90:\n  - Is 90 % 2 == 0? Yes.\n  - Is 90 % 3 == 0? Yes.\n  - Is 90 % 5 == 0? Yes.\n  - Is 90 % 7 == 0? No. Least prime not dividing 90 is 7. Index of 7 is 4. So a(90) = 4.\n\nMy manual calculation for 87, 88, 89, 90 gives [1, 2, 1, 4].\nLet's compare this with the options:\nA. [2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nB. [4, 5, 4, 7, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 6]\nC. [2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4]\nD. [2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]\nE. [1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3]\nF. [0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\nG. [3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5]\nH. [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 3]\n\nMy calculated sequence [1, 2, 1, 4] matches the beginning of option E. This suggests my interpretation of the algorithm is correct.\n\nThe `microsandbox` execution failing without `stdout` or `stderr` is problematic. I will try to simplify the code and ensure it's robust. I will also explicitly print the `y_list` at the end.\n\nLet's try to make the `is_prime` function more efficient or at least less prone to errors.\nThe `calculate_a_n` function seems correct.\n\nI will try to run the code again, ensuring the JSON string is correctly formatted and the code is robust. I will also add a `print` statement for debugging.\n</think>\n<microsandbox>\n  <microsandbox_execute>\n    {\n      \"code\": \"import math\\\\n\\\\ndef is_prime(num):\\\\n    if num < 2:\\\\n        return False\\\\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):\\\\n        if num % i == 0:\\\\n            return False\\\\n    return True\\\\n\\\\ndef calculate_a_n(n):\\\\n    prime_index = 0\\\\n    current_prime = 2\\\\n    primes = []\\\\n    while True:\\\\n        if is_prime(current_prime):\\\\n            primes.append(current_prime)\\\\n            prime_index += 1\\\\n            if n % current_prime != 0:\\\\n                return prime_index\\\\n        current_prime += 1\\\\n\\\\nx_list = [87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]\\\\ny_list = []\\\\n\\\\nfor x in x_list:\\\\n    y_list.append(calculate_a_n(x))\\\\n\\\\nprint(y_list)\"\n    }\n  </microsandbox_execute>\n</microsandbox>\n<execute_tools />\n<result>{\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"error\": \"\",\n  \"processing_time_ms\": 2069\n}</result>\n\n<think>\nIt failed again with `success: false` and no error message. This is very unhelpful. It's possible there's an issue with the `microsandbox` environment itself, or a very subtle error in my code that isn't producing a standard error output.\n\nGiven the consistent failure without specific error messages, I will try a different approach. I will break down the problem into smaller parts and execute them step-by-step in the sandbox, or try to get more verbose output.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to use `deepsearch` to find a prime number generator or a function that finds the nth prime, and then adapt it. However, the current problem is about finding the *index* of the *least prime not dividing n*.\n\nLet's try to simplify the code even further to isolate the issue. I will just try to print a simple list to see if the sandbox is working at all.\n</think>\n<microsandbox>\n  <microsandbox_execute>\n    {\n      \"code\": \"print([1, 2, 3])\"\n    }\n  </microsandbox_execute>\n</microsandbox>\n<execute_tools />\n<result>{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"stdout\": \"[1, 2, 3]\\n\",\n    \"stderr\": \"\",\n    \"return_code\": 0,\n    \"execution_time\": 2.063352108001709,\n    \"session_id\": null,\n    \"timeout_used\": 30,\n    \"timeout_note\": \"MicroSandbox使用内部超时机制，此参数仅供参考\"\n  },\n  \"output\": {\n    \"stdout\": \"[1, 2, 3]\\n\",\n    \"stderr\": \"\",\n    \"return_code\": 0,\n    \"execution_time\": 2.063352108001709,\n    \"session_id\": null,\n    \"timeout_used\": 30,\n    \"timeout_note\": \"MicroSandbox使用内部超时机制，此参数仅供参考\"\n  },\n  \"processing_time_ms\": 2066\n}</result>\n\n\n<think>\nOkay, the sandbox is working for simple print statements. This means the issue is with my Python code logic or its complexity. The previous `success: false` without `stderr` is still puzzling, but at least I know the sandbox itself is functional.\n\nThe problem is likely in the `calculate_a_n` function, specifically the `while True` loop and the prime generation. Generating primes one by one and checking divisibility might be inefficient for larger numbers or the loop might be running too long, hitting an implicit timeout.\n\nLet's re-examine the definition: \"index of the least prime not dividing n\".\nThis means we need to iterate through primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...) and for each prime `p`, check if `n % p != 0`. The first `p` for which this condition is true, its index is the answer.\n\nI will rewrite the `calculate_a_n` function to be more explicit and potentially more efficient for the given range of `n` (up to 96). I will pre-define a list of primes up to a reasonable limit (e.g., 100, as the largest `n` is 96, and we need primes that might not divide it).\n\nPrimes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, ...\nThe index of 2 is 1, 3 is 2, 5 is 3, 7 is 4, 11 is 5, 13 is 6, 17 is 7, 19 is 8, 23 is 9, 29 is 10, 31 is 11.\n\nLet's try the code again with a pre-defined list of primes. This avoids the `is_prime` function and the `while True` loop for prime generation, which might be the source of the timeout or error.\n</think>\n<microsandbox>\n  <microsandbox_execute>\n    {\n      \"code\": \"\nprimes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113] # Primes up to a reasonable limit\n\ndef calculate_a_n(n):\n    for i, p in enumerate(primes):\n        if n % p != 0:\n            return i + 1 # Return 1-based index\n    return -1 # Should not happen for typical n, as there's always a prime not dividing it\n\nx_list = [87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]\ny_list = []\n\nfor x in x_list:\n    y_list.append(calculate_a_n(x))\n\nprint(y_list)\n      \"\n    }\n  </microsandbox_execute>\n</microsandbox>\n<execute_tools />\n<result>Parameter Validation Failed \n\nTool Call: microsandbox.microsandbox_execute\nError Details: Parameter validation failed for microsandbox.microsandbox_execute: ['JSON格式错误: Invalid control character at: line 2 column 16 (char 17)']\n\nYour Input: {\n      \"code\": \"\nprimes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113] # Primes up to a reasonable limit\n\ndef calculate_a_n(n):\n    for i, p in enumerate(primes):\n        if n % p != 0:\n            return i + 1 # Return 1-based index\n    return -1 # Should not happen for typical n, as there's always a prime not dividing it\n\nx_list = [87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]\ny_list = []\n\nfor x in x_list:\n    y_list.append(calculate_a_n(x))\n\nprint(y_list)\n      \"\n    }\n\nCorrection Suggestions: Use <tool_param><tool_id>microsandbox</tool_id><action>microsandbox_execute</action></tool_param> to get the correct parameters\n\nPlease retry the tool call with correct parameters based on the error information above.</result>\n\n\n\n<think>\nI keep making the same mistake with the JSON formatting for the `code` parameter.

I will examine the summaries to find the most relevant information.\n\nResult 1 mentions: \"The common cap rocks consist of claystone, sandstone, conglomerate, and clayey limestone type sedimentary rocks\".\nResult 7 mentions: \"Cap rock can be divided into three main categories based on the lithological classification: mudstone, evaporite and carbonate rock\".\n\nLet's compare these findings with the given options:\n\nA. siltstone rock, limestone rock, chalk\nB. shale rock, silica rock, calcite rock\nC. mud rock, granite rock, claystone rock\nD. granite rock, sedimentary rock, metamorphic rock\nE. limestone rock, marble rock, sandstone rock\nF. gypsum salt rock, clay rock, carbonate rock\nG. dolomite rock, sand rock, igneous rock\nH. basalt rock, quartzite rock, slate rock\nI. quartz rock, obsidian rock, pumice rock\nJ. pebble rock, coal rock, flint rock\n\nFrom the search results, common cap rocks include:\n- Claystone (similar to clay rock, mud rock, shale)\n- Sandstone (similar to sand rock)\n- Limestone (a type of carbonate rock)\n- Conglomerate (a type of sedimentary rock)\n- Mudstone (similar to mud rock, clay rock, shale)\n- Evaporite (e.g., gypsum salt rock)\n- Carbonate rock (e.g., limestone, dolomite)\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on these common types:\n\n*   **A. siltstone rock, limestone rock, chalk**: Limestone is good. Siltstone is plausible. Chalk is a type of limestone. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **B. shale rock, silica rock, calcite rock**: Shale is plausible. Calcite is a mineral in limestone. Silica rock is less common as a primary cap rock type.\n*   **C. mud rock, granite rock, claystone rock**: Mud rock and claystone are good. Granite is an igneous rock and generally not a cap rock.\n*   **D. granite rock, sedimentary rock, metamorphic rock**: Granite is incorrect. Sedimentary rock is a broad category, but specific types are needed. Metamorphic rocks are generally not cap rocks.\n*   **E. limestone rock, marble rock, sandstone rock**: Limestone and sandstone are good. Marble is a metamorphic rock, generally not a cap rock.\n*   **F. gypsum salt rock, clay rock, carbonate rock**: Gypsum salt rock (evaporite), clay rock (similar to claystone/mudstone), and carbonate rock (e.g., limestone) are all very strong matches based on the search results. This option seems to cover the main categories well.\n*   **G. dolomite rock, sand rock, igneous rock**: Dolomite and sand rock are plausible. Igneous rock is generally incorrect.\n*   **H. basalt rock, quartzite rock, slate rock**: These are igneous and metamorphic rocks, generally not cap rocks.\n*   **I. quartz rock, obsidian rock, pumice rock**: These are igneous rocks or minerals, generally not cap rocks.\n*   **J. pebble rock, coal rock, flint rock**: These are less common as primary cap rock lithologies.\n\nComparing option A and F, option F seems to encompass the broader categories mentioned in the search results more accurately (evaporite, clay rock/mudstone/shale, carbonate rock). Specifically, Result 7 states \"mudstone, evaporite and carbonate rock\" as main categories. Gypsum salt rock is an evaporite, clay rock is similar to mudstone, and carbonate rock is explicitly mentioned.\n\nTherefore, option F appears to be the most comprehensive and accurate answer based on the search results.\n</think>\n<answer>\\boxed{F. gypsum salt rock, clay rock, carbonate rock}</answer></execute_tools></execute_tools></execute_tools></execute_tools>", "preprocessing_notes": "Format issues detected and corrected", "preprocessing_metadata": {"tool_call_count": 8, "has_duplicates": false, "format_corrected": true, "tag_analysis": {"think": 6, "deepsearch": 3, "result": 5, "tool_param": 1, "browser_use": 1, "execute_tools": 4}}}
