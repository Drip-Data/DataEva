While bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm in general (O(n^2) time complexity), it is correctly implemented and suitable for small lists like the test cases provided.  There are no apparent edge cases or errors to handle in this specific scenario, so error handling is not explicitly tested but also not required here.
